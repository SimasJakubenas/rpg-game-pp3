## UX Design

### The Strategy Plane

With this project I'll be attempting to create a simple yet functional RPG type game that is run in terminal. The game is themed based on a classic game (Diablo II) and will have standart RPG mechanics like exploring the map, battling enemies and upgrading your character.

#### Target Audience

Main target audience for this project is millennials who grew up playing classic games like Diablo II. This game will spark a sense of nostalgia in players mind and captivate them throughout the gameplay. Having said that anyone that loves RPG games or gaming in general will have a fun time playing 'Tal Rasha'.

#### Problem Statement

Spending time playing games is almost never an option when you become an adult :(. Especially RPG genre games that requires a player to put in hours uppon hours of gameplay. 

#### Competitor Annalisys

While this project is nowhere near Diablo II or it's moderated versions (some of which are still going strong to this day) it still offers few advantages:

- You can complete it quite quickly
- No downloads or registration required

### The Scope Plane

#### User Stories

##### First Time User Goals:

- FTU_01 As a first-time user, I want to discern what kind of game this is  immediately, so that I know I'm in the right place
- FTU_02 As a first-time user, I want to be able to navigate the game flow intuitively, so that I can enjoy playing it
- FTU_03 As a first-time user, I want to play an RPG type game, so that I have a fun way to pass my time
- FTU_04 As a first-time user, I want to be faced with a level of difficulty, so that I can be engaged by the gameplay 
- FTU_05 As a first-time user, I want to see the progression of the game based on my decisions, so that I can be motivated to continue playing.
- FTU_06 As a first-time user, I want to be able to complete the game, so that I feel rewarded

##### Returning User Goals:

- RU_01 As a returning user, I want to be able to save/load the game, so I can continue playing another time
- RU_02 As a returning user, I want to see if there's an update to the game, so I can replay it
- RU_03 As a returning user, I want to explore all areas, so that I can encounter all the enemies.

##### Developer Goals:

- SD_01 As a developer, I want to provide a fun and engaging RPG style game, so that others would be able to enjoy it.
- SD_02 As a developer, I want to save game content on google spreadsheets, so that I can add more content without changing the code.
- SD_03 As a developer, I want to have a platform on  which I can build continuosly, so that I could realize my passion.

##### Future Development:

- FTU_06 As a first-time user, I want to be able to hear sounds of the game, I that I could be engaged more.
- FTU_07 As a first-time user, I want to be able to select a different character of the game, so that I'm more inclined to repeat the game.
